There are different types of validation:

1-Schema Validation: Ensures that data follows the structure defined by the database schema. For example, enforcing data types, constraints (such as NOT NULL), and relationships.

2-Client-Side Validation: Performed before submitting data, usually using JavaScript, to catch errors early.

3-Server-Side Validation: Ensures data integrity at the backend, preventing invalid data from being inserted into the database.

4-Custom Validation: Developers define specific validation rules according to business logic, such as requiring a strong password or checking that an email format is correct
